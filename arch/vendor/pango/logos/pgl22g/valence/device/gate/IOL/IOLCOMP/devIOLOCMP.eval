  Abstract  [The structure netlist of devIOLOCMP is described in the similar fashion
             as in HDL. In unit instantiation statement, the formal pin may be
             connected to net which is declared explicitly.

             In Valence, the connection can also be made from formal pin to other
             pin or port, in which case Valence compiler shall create the net to
             fulfil the connection. The built-in naming convention is kicked in
             to name the automatically created net. However, the objects (net, instance)
             of this netlist are going to mapped from schematic. The compiler-generated
             names cause trouble for the mapping. Therefore, all wires are declared
             explicitly in the following description]
