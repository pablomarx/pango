  Abstract  [The structure netlist of OSC is described in the similar fashion 
             as in HDL. In unit instantiation statement, the formal pin may be 
             connected to net which is declared explicitly. 
             
             In Valence, the connection can also be made from formal pin to other 
             pin or port, in which case Valence compiler shall create the net to 
             fulfil the connection. The built-in naming convention is kicked in 
             to name the automatically created net. However, the objects (net, instance)
             of this netlist are going to mapped from schematic. The compiler-generated
             names cause trouble for the mapping. Therefore, all wires are declared
             explicitly in the following description]
