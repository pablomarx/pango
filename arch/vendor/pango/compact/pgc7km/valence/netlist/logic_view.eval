  Abstract  [Describe the GUI view of logic structure of the architecture. In logic
             description, the entire array is 2D uniform. However, to accommodate the
             clock resource, the entire array is partitioned into 2 parts, left and right
             part. 

             In the following description, schematics of various tiles are instantiated to
             form the entire schematic of the architecture.]
